Phone API tested on: API 25

I was stuck on how to deal with the null values that I was attaining for a while. I had considered trying to skip the holder entirely but couldn't figure out a way to do that. Originally I had though of going through the list and not adding the elements that had a null value for their username. The paper also asks us to recieve user from a user object, I was ensure of which list to inflate the usernames for after that.

Ended up solving the issue while writing the readme! I need a lot of work on my organization.
